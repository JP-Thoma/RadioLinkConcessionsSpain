## LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Over the course of 14 sessions, and within the constant guidance of the professor, students
working in teams will try to solve a real business case of data analysis in the "safe environment‚Äù of
a Master degree. Competition with their peers will force them to combine in a balanced way such
essential aspects as their technical and analytical abilities, the management of group work or their
personal soft skills.
In this context, it is the objective of this course to expose students to a learning experience that
mimics real life working challenges and or competitions. These latter are proving, day after day, to
be essential parts of any data scientist/analyst portfolio.
Challenge is important for students: it forces them to grow and pushes themselves outside their
safety nets to explore and maximize their potentials. Studies have proved that exposing students to
challenges can improve their overall analytical and soft skills, as long as there is a fine balance
between challenge and frustration.
Throughout the course, students will reinforce three classes of skills:

### TECHNICAL & ANALYTICAL
- Develop a clear and consistent approach to analyze data
- Strengthen their programming and analytical skills (R, Python, SPSS)
- Deepen and develop their statistical and computational thinking.

### WORK IN THE CONTEXT OF BUSINESS DATA CONSULTING
- Develop a fruitful interaction with the business manager and data owner throughout the process
- Understand the necessary balance between the technical complexity of a development and its
  business viability
- Learn how to work in a balanced, effective, efficient and viable deployment of technical solution
- Enhance risk analysis
- Practice effective communication of results

### SOFT SKILLS
- Improve teamwork and collaboration
- Build mental toughness
- Enhance social and emotional learning
- Enhance beneficial peer comparisons
